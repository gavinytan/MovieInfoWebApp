This is the prototype version of the app, now with added login functionality. 
To login go to localhost:5000/google. This will pull up a google login screen. After you log in it should redirect you back to the prototype app (localhost:3000). 
You can use localhost:5000/good to verify you have been logged in (it should display your Google display name).

(You might have to manually install some node_modules after doing npm install)
